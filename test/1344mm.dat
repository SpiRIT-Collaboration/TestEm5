 ======================== run summary ======================

 The run was 10000 proton of 400 MeV through 1.34 m   of P10 (density: 1.53 mg/cm3)

 Total energy deposit in absorber per event = 458 keV +- 1.034 keV

 -----> Mean dE/dx = 0.003408 MeV/cm	(2.227 MeV*cm2/g)

 From formulas :
   restricted dEdx = 0.003101 MeV/cm	(2.027 MeV*cm2/g)
   full dEdx       = 0.003528 MeV/cm	(2.306 MeV*cm2/g)

 Leakage :  primary = 399.5 MeV +- 1.479 keV   secondaries = 10.96 keV +- 695.7 eV 
 Energy balance :  edep + eleak = 400 MeV

 Total track length (charged) in absorber per event = 1.435 m   +- 2.303 mm 
 Total track length (neutral) in absorber per event = 1.366 mm  +- 270.9 um 

 Number of steps (charged) in absorber per event = 577.3 +- 0.01518
 Number of steps (neutral) in absorber per event = 0.0063 +- 0.01518

 Number of secondaries per event : Gammas = 0.0063;   electrons = 0.2656;   positrons = 0

 Number of events with the primary particle transmitted = 100 %
 Number of events with at least  1 particle transmitted (same charge as primary) = 100 %
